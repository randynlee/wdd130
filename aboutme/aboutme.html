    <h2>Randy Lee</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Randy. My wife and I currently reside in West Jordan, Utah. 
        We have four children: a 21 year old daughter (currently serving a mission in Canada), 
        19 year old son (just received a calling to Panama), 8 year old son, and 7 year old son.</p>
    <p>When I'm not at work or serving in my church calling, I'm studying with my kids and 
        playing with my two younger boys. The energy these kids have, helped me appreciate 
        what my own parents must have gone through with me and my siblings.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in Italy and my wife is from Mexico, so inevitably my favorite foods 
        have become Italian and Mexican.</p>
    <p>I currently work in the IT field. I'm hoping the things I learn from these 
        courses will help me stay relevant and help me with career advancement in the field. 
        As of yet, I don't know all of the reasons I'm pursuing a degree, 
        but I have felt inspired to pursue it at this time.</p>
